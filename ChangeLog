EmilPRO (3):
	* Gtk GUI: Partailly fix the remember window-size-on-close feature

	* Issue #3: Allow switching between AT&T/Intel syntax on x86

	* Refactor code to make it easier to share code between GTK/QT

	* Correct build on some Fedora systems (look for libs in lib64)

	* Improve constness of many method prototypes

	* QT GUI: Implement a mostly-done QT-based GUI

	* Really fix the Sweden-is-not-the-world bug. current-ip -> current_ip in both
	  places works really well...
