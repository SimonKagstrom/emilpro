## Requirements

### Debian and Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install g++ cmake ninja-build python3-pip binutils-multiarch-dev qt6-base-dev libglx-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
pip3 install conan
```

### Fedora

Still TODO, but more or less like Ubuntu.

### MacOS

```
brew install binutils qt6 conan cmake ninja
```

## Build

The instructions below are for release builds. For debug builds, replace `Release` with `Debug`, and then
also unit tests will be built.

### Conan setup

```
conan install -of build --build=missing -s build_type=Release conanfile.txt
```

### Linux

```
cmake -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="`pwd`/build/build/Release/generators/" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build
```

### MacOS

Remove binutils from the PATH (for the conan build)

```
conan install -of build --build=missing -s build_type=Release conanfile.txt
```

```
cmake -B build -GNinja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="`pwd`build/build/Release/generators/;`brew --prefix binutils`" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build
```

## Installation

```
sudo cp qt/emilpro/emilpro /usr/local/bin/
```
